# zLang
An interpreted WORK IN PROGRESS programming language built with c++
zLang is made in c++ but in the way a C developer would do it

zLang follow a very STRICT way of typing, spaces are requiered between every keyword

Here are some of its functionalities:

**Declare Variables**

Current types: nr [Number]

```zLang
nr x = 69
```

**Increment/decrement Variables**

```zLang
nr x = 10
nr y = 10

y += x
y += 1
x -= y
x -= 5
```

**Print Text & Variables**

```zLang
nr x = 10
nr y = 10

y += x
y += 1
x -= y
x -= 5

print this is x: $x and this is y: $y
```
